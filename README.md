In this project I have made a detailed analysis on the insurance data and applied various Machine learning Algorithm Such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest and found out which one works the best.
Here I got a R*2 score of 0.86 on Polynomial regression which is the highest among all the algorithms used.
